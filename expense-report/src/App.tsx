  /*
    useEffect new topic
    Effect hook is to execute piece of code after component is rendered
    lets say there is an input put field and you want to focus on it 
    after it is rendered (may be when user moves the cursor there, will come to that)
    if you just add focus, the component becomes impure
    but if you add focus piece of code insder useEffect function, component is convereted as pure again??
    the ref for focus on input field is a side effect; input field is rendered already
    but when moust moved, focus on it; blue shade around input field
    NOTE: to avoid infinite loop of calling the useEffect, you need to add dependency 
    as param to the useEffect arrow function; [] empty one is for doing the effect once
    after component is rendered
    you can also control it to run the effect after use action on the browse like selecting an item
    similar to useState, useEffect can be called on top component and not inside loops or if condition
    multiple calls of useEffect is possible
    see the document.title below

    useEffect Dependencies: executes after each render, but you have to avoid infinite loop

  //when you click Delete, the user object shd be used by the deleteUser function
  //which is called later than when passed

  //for createUser you dont need a callback because its a new user getting created when called

  //their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated
  //and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
